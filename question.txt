1. how to call a function from the outside of the scope  (signIn())
2. what are the differences between "customer.email" and "data->email"?  (attribute and array?) how about "data['email']" and "data->email" ?
3. is it possible that in <text type>, first readonly attribute is enable, push modify button,then change readonly attribute to disable?

1. What is .user? Where define "user.profile" ?  <--- What should I do if I want to add profile.html into the link?




idea 
index(profile) -> sign (get user information) ->profile.html (display result(read only)) ->modify or OK(return to home)
   modify -> update the information -> OK or Cancel
