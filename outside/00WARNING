Important!
----------

Files in this directory are meant to carry sensitive information!

The ".php.in" files are meant to be copied into '.php' and filled in
with the actual authentication information.

Alternatively, you can decrypt the ".gpg" files with
    $ gpg file.php.gpg
They contain sensitive information, which, however, may need to be adjusted
to your needs.

Either way - if you choose to fill in the real values, or if you choose
to decrypt the encrypted ".gpg" files -- MAKE SURE that you move
the resulting files out of the publicly served area (such as "public_html")!

No sensitive information should be sitting in the public area at all times!!

Presumably, the resulting Php files will be sitting outside of the Git repository,
so the repository will not be affected by the fact that you have extracted
or filled in real authentication information

No sensitive information should be sitting in the Git repository!!
(unless encrypted)
